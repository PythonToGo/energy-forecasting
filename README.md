# Energy Forecasting System

This project uses public energy consumption datasets to build an Machine Learning - based prediction system, exposes it via REST API using FastAPI, and visualizes it through Streamlit! Full MLOps features (MLflow, DVC, Prefect) are included.

## Features
- Time-series energy forecasting using XGBoost
- REST API service with FastAPI
- Streamlit dashboard for result visualization
- MLOps pipeline (MLflow + DVC + Prefect)
- Dockerized for easy deployment
